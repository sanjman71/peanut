== Rails 2.2 bugs

This problem with time conversion seems to be causing problems on our appointments/index page:

http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1339

/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-2.2.2/lib/active_record/attribute_methods.rb:142:in `create_time_zone_conversion_attribute?'

One fix is to change config.cache_classes = true in your development.rb.

== Getting Started

1. Run the rake task <tt>rake db:peanut:init</tt> to initialize the database with some test data.

2. Run the rake task <tt>rake db:peanut:freetime:init[days] to setup from freetime.

3. Edit your /etc/hosts file by adding the following lines:
    127.0.0.1     www.peanut.dev
    127.0.0.1     peanut.dev peanut.test
    127.0.0.1     peanut.peanut.dev   # add this line for each company you create
  
4. Go to http://www.peanut.dev:3000/.  From here, you can login or signup.

== Populating the database

There are a few tasks that can be used to populate random data into the database.  

The current tasks populate the people and products database.  The tasks are:
  - rake db:populate:people[count]
  - rake db:populate:products[count]
  
Note that only the first company in the database is populated.  This also means you need at least 1 company for these tasks to run correctly.

== Configuring/Starting Starling, Workling, ...

1. All processes are started and monitored by the god daemon.  The config/god/user.yml specifies the user, group values to use in the development environment. (We should probably have a better way of configuring based on different development environments)

2. Install the god gem:
  - sudo gem install god

3. Start the god daemon
  - sudo god -c config/peanut.god 
  
== Badges

The administrative page is accessible here:
http://localhost:3000/badges/admin/index
I'll figure out a better solution to this, but in the meantime you can use this to administer it.

Migration 003_... includes creating all the tables, the two default roles 'admin' and 'authorized', which are for admin users and all users respectively. All users created are automatically assigned the authorized role.
Migration 004... adds the peanut specific roles 'company manager' and 'company employee', along with privileges 'create company', 'read company', 'update company' and 'delete company'. I provided initial assignments of these privileges to the two roles.

This provides us with initial support. Next I need to start adding privilege requirements to models, views and controllers. Watch this space.

== SSL Setup and Testing in development

Excellent tutorial at:

http://www.ricroberts.com/articles/2008/09/25/setting-up-ssl-for-rails-and-testing-it-locally

The local apache configuration on a mac lives in /etc/apache2.

To start apache:
  - sudo httpd -k start
  
To stop apache:
  - sudo httpd -k stop
  
Apache listens on port 80 and 443, and proxies to webbrick or mongrel (usually on port 3000 in dev).

Uses the ssl_requirement plugin to enforce secure actions.
