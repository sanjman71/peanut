== Getting Started

1. Run the rake task <tt>rake db:peanut:init</tt> to initialize the database with some test data.

2. Run the rake task <tt>rake db:peanut:freetime:init[days] to setup from freetime.

3. Edit your /etc/hosts file by adding the following lines:
    127.0.0.1     www.localhost
    127.0.0.1     company1.localhost
    127.0.0.1     company2.localhost
    127.0.0.1     company3.localhost
  
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/companies to view/add companies.

5. Go to http://company1.localhost:3000/appointments to see appointments for a company.


== Configuring/Starting Starling and Workling

1. Start the starling daemon: 
   - sudo starling -d -p 22122

2. Start the workling client and monitor
   - ./script/workling_client start

== Badges
The administrative page is accessible here:
http://localhost:3000/badges/admin/index
I'll figure out a better solution to this, but in the meantime you can use this to administer it.

Migration 003_... includes creating all the tables, the two default roles 'admin' and 'authorized', which are for admin users and all users respectively. All users created are automatically assigned the authorized role.
Migration 004... adds the peanut specific roles 'company manager' and 'company employee', along with privileges 'create company', 'read company', 'update company' and 'delete company'. I provided initial assignments of these privileges to the two roles.

This provides us with initial support. Next I need to start adding privilege requirements to models, views and controllers. Watch this space.
