    Upgrades your installed software packages.

    From the aptitude man pages:

      This command will upgrade as many packages as it can upgrade without \
      removing existing packages or installing new ones.

      It is sometimes necessary to remove or install one package in order to \
      upgrade another; this command is not able to upgrade packages in such \
      situations. Use the full-upgrade to upgrade those packages as well.

    http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/11/6/ubuntu-gutsy-setup-page-2

    # By default, OVH replace the original /etc/issue. The safe_upgrade will then ask \
    # if it must overwrite this file, since it has been modified by OVH. \

    Upgrades your installed software packages.

    From the aptitude man pages:

      Like safe-upgrade, this command will attempt to upgrade packages, but it is \
      more aggressive about solving dependency problems: it will install and \
      remove packages until all dependencies are satisfied. Because of the nature \
      of this command, it is possible that it will do undesirable things, and so \
      you should be careful when using it.
